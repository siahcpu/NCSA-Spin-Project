New Cardboard Mobile Materials Visualizer
This is my summer project in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications as a SPIN program intern.
This project is based on the source code provided by Nicole Adelstein (nadelstein@gmail.com) and Andre Schleife (schleife@illinois.edu).
The files that are created by them as a starter code is phonons.html and rotation.html.

This project is intended to be a fully working website that has a fully functional backend to store various vesta data files. The front end
should be intuitive and allows the user to see different visualized atomic structures in a stereoscopic view via google cardboard.

Current feature:

Support dynamic parsing of vesta files to generate a stereoscopic view. 
Support the conventional CPK chemistry coloring of atoms.
Support different atom proportions by using covalent radius of atoms.
Support background audio explanation.
Support Ball and Stick style atomic sturecture view. 

Will incorporate(by May 31):
A fully functional front end and backend skeleton code by using MEAN stack web development tools.
Functionalities to generate different atomic structure views such as Space-filling, Polyhedral, WireFrame and Stick views.
